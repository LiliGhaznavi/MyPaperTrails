          Hi, I’m Lili Ghaznavi. I’m passionate about learning, creating, and
          sharing ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this space, I invite you to join me on my journey as I explore
          various aspects of my life—from my creative projects to the lessons
          I’ve learned along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where I share the stories that shape my world, the experiences
          that inspire me, and the passions that drive my work. Whether it’s
          design, technology, or the simple joys of everyday life, you’ll find a
          little bit of everything here :)
        </p>
        <p>Welcome to my world—let’s explore together!</p>
