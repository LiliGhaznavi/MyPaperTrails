          <p>Hi there! 😊</p>
          <p>
            Let me take you back to my school days. For as long as I can
            remember, I’ve always loved creating—especially PowerPoint
            presentations. I found something magical in the process of putting
            slides together, arranging elements, and bringing ideas to life. And
            it wasn’t just about the final product; I loved how others would
            react, saying, "Wow, how did you do that with just PowerPoint?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, I realize that I didn’t know at the time that this
            simple act of creating could lead me to where I am today. The thing
            is, no one ever really pushed me to dive deeper into this passion.
            All I heard was, “Focus on your lessons, take good grades, those
            things don’t matter as much.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To be honest, school never quite felt like the place where I could
            really grow. In my country, subjects like music, philosophy,
            computer science, and graphic design just didn’t have a place. Kids
            with these talents often felt overlooked, their strengths ignored,
            and instead, everyone was measured by their grades, not their
            passions or creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here’s where it gets interesting—during all those hours of
            reading textbooks that didn’t excite me, I found myself creating
            pictures, experimenting with them, and playing around. One day, I
            opened Photoshop and just started clicking buttons. I had no idea
            what I was doing, but I could edit photos and create something new.
            And then, it hit me: “Wow! What a beautiful tool! How amazing is
            this?” I wanted to learn more, and that was the first spark that
            ignited my creative journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            From that moment on, there was no turning back. Photoshop opened a
            whole new world for me, and I couldn’t wait to see where it would
            take me next. So, that’s how it all began—a simple love for creating
            something from nothing, and a curious mind that couldn’t stop
            exploring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for being here with me on this journey! Let’s see where it
            takes us. ✨
